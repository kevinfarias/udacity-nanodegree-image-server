Hello!

For using this application, use these commands:
Build:
`npm run build`

Test:
`npm run test`

Lint:
`npm run lint`

Start:
`npm run start`

The endpoint is only:
`/convert`
That will take all the images located in the ./images/full folder and convert it to smaller images and put into the ./images/converted folder.

It is expected that if the output image already exists, that the endpoint will not recreat it.
